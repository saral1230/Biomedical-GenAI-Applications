It has strong epidemiologic and biologic links to tobacco \ncarcinogens. Although the majority of SCLCs exhibit neuroendocrine features, an \nimportant subset of tumors lacks these properties. Genomic profiling of SCLC \nreveals genetic instability, almost universal inactivation of the tumor \nsuppressor genes TP53 and RB1, and a high mutation burden. Because of early \nmetastasis, only a small fraction of patients are amenable to curative-intent \nlung resection, and these individuals require adjuvant platinum-etoposide \nchemotherapy. Therefore, the vast majority of patients are currently being \ntreated with chemoradiation with or without immunotherapy. In patients with \ndisease confined to the chest, standard therapy includes thoracic radiotherapy \nand concurrent platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. Patients with metastatic \n(extensive-stage) disease are treated with a combination of platinum-etoposide \nchemotherapy plus immunotherapy with an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \nmonoclonal antibody. Although SCLC is initially very responsive to \nplatinum-based chemotherapy, these responses are transient because of the \ndevelopment of drug resistance. In recent years, the authors have witnessed an \naccelerating pace of biologic insights into the disease, leading to the \nredefinition of the SCLC classification scheme. This emerging knowledge of SCLC \nmolecular subtypes has the potential to define unique therapeutic \nvulnerabilities. Synthesizing these new discoveries with the current knowledge \nof SCLC biology and clinical management may lead to unprecedented advances in \nSCLC patient care. Here, the authors present an overview of multimodal clinical \napproaches in SCLC, with a special focus on illuminating how recent advancements \nin SCLC research could accelerate clinical development.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

SCLC is strongly associated with exposure \nto tobacco carcinogens. Most patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, with \nonly one-third having earlier-stage disease that is amenable to potentially \ncurative multimodality therapy. Genomic profiling of SCLC reveals extensive \nchromosomal rearrangements and a high mutation burden, almost always including \nfunctional inactivation of the tumour suppressor genes TP53 and RB1. Analyses of \nboth human SCLC and murine models have defined subtypes of disease based on the \nrelative expression of dominant transcriptional regulators and have also \nrevealed substantial intratumoural heterogeneity. Aspects of this heterogeneity \nhave been implicated in tumour evolution, metastasis and acquired therapeutic \nresistance. Although clinical progress in SCLC treatment has been notoriously \nslow, a better understanding of the biology of disease has uncovered novel \nvulnerabilities that might be amenable to targeted therapeutic approaches. The \nrecent introduction of immune checkpoint blockade into the treatment of patients \nwith SCLC is offering new hope, with a small subset of patients deriving \nprolonged benefit. Strategies to direct targeted therapies to those patients who \nare most likely to respond and to extend the durable benefit of effective \nantitumour immunity to a greater fraction of patients are urgently needed and \nare now being actively explored.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s41572-020-00235-0\nPMCID: PMC8177722\nPMID: 33446664 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n3.

Human lung cancers are classified into two major types, small cell lung \ncancer (SCLC) and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The latter accounts for \napproximately 80% of all primary lung cancers, and the incidence of NSCLC is \nincreasing yearly. Most clinical studies suggest that NSCLC with TP53 \nalterations carries a worse prognosis and may be relatively more resistant to \nchemotherapy and radiation. A deep understanding of the role of TP53 in lung \ncarcinogenesis may lead to a more reasonably targeted clinical approach, which \nshould be exploited to enhance the survival rates of patients with lung cancer. \nThis paper will focus on the role of TP53 in the molecular pathogenesis, \nepidemiology, and therapeutic strategies of TP53 mutation in NSCLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1155/2011/583929\nPMCID: PMC3035360\nPMID: 21331359 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n4.

Comprehensive genomic assessments of \nSCLC have revealed that most of these tumours harbour deletions of the \ntumour-suppressor genes TP53 and RB1 but, in contrast to non-small-cell lung \ncancer, have failed to identify targetable alterations. The expression status of \nfour transcription factors with key roles in SCLC pathogenesis defines distinct \nmolecular subtypes of the disease, potentially enabling specific therapeutic \napproaches. Overexpression and amplification of MYC paralogues also affect the \nbiology and therapeutic vulnerabilities of SCLC. Several other attractive \ntargets have emerged in the past few years, including inhibitors of \nDNA-damage-response pathways, epigenetic modifiers, antibody-drug conjugates and \nchimeric antigen receptor T cells. However, the rapid development of therapeutic \nresistance and lack of biomarkers for effective selection of patients with SCLC \nare ongoing challenges. Emerging single-cell RNA sequencing data are providing \ninsights into the plasticity and intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity \nof SCLC that might be associated with therapeutic resistance. In this Review, we \nprovide a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in genomic and \ntranscriptomic characterization of SCLC with a particular focus on opportunities \nfor translation into new therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes.\n\n\u00a9 2024.

The tumors were mostly negative for thyroid transcription \nfactor-1 (TTF-1), CD34, and p40 and positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) in \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC). Nineteen SMARCA4-dNSCLC patients mostly had TP53, \nSMARCA4, and LRP1B mutations, and 48% of them had SMARCA4 frameshift mutations. \nSMARCA4-dNSCLC patients have a worse prognosis than SMARCA4-iNSCLC patients (HR: \n0.27; 95% CI: 0.17-0.45). The overall survival (OS) of patients with stage III \nSMARCA4-dNSCLC was worse than that of patients with SMARCA4-iNSCLC, and the OS \nof stage IV SMARCA4-dNSCLC patients was also worse than that of SMARCA4-iNSCLC \npatients (p\u2009<\u20090.01). (2) Multivariate regression analysis showed that sex (HR: \n4.12; 95% CI: 1.03-16.39) and smoking history (HR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.04-5.02) had \nsignificant effects on the survival time of SMARCA4-dNSCLC patients. In \nSMARCA4-dNSCLC patients without distant metastases (stage I-III), patients with \nstage N2 or N3 lymph node metastases (HR: 6.35; 95% CI: 1.07-37.47) had a poor \nprognosis. Among patients with SMARCA4-dNSCLC who were treated and had distant \nmetastases (stage IV), male patients and patients treated with immunotherapy \ncombined with chemotherapy showed a longer median overall survival (mOS).\nCONCLUSION: SMARCA4-dNSCLC has unique clinicopathological features and a shorter \nsurvival prognosis than SMARCA4-iNSCLC. The efficacy of immunotherapy combined \nwith chemotherapy needs to be observed for longer periods.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Histological transformation from NSCLC to SCLC has been \nreported as a mechanism of treatment resistance in patients who received \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR, ALK and ROS1 or \nimmunotherapies. The transformed histology could be due to therapy-induced \nlineage plasticity or clonal selection of pre-existing SCLC cells. Evidence \nsupporting either mechanism exist in the literature. Here, we discuss potential \nmechanisms of transformation and review the current knowledge about cell of \norigin of NSCLC and SCLC. In addition, we summarize genomic alterations that are \nfrequently observed in both \"de novo\" and transformed SCLC, such as TP53, RB1 \nand PIK3CA. We also discuss treatment options for transformed SCLC, including \nchemotherapy, radiotherapy, TKIs, immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic agents.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Cisplatin is \na first-line treatment option for NSCLC, and the p53 mutation is a major factor \nin chemoresistance. We demonstrate that cisplatin chemotherapy increases the \nrisk of TP53 mutations, further contributing to cisplatin resistance. \nEncouragingly, we find that the combination of cisplatin and fluvastatin can \nalleviate this problem. Therefore, we synthesize Fluplatin, a prodrug consisting \nof cisplatin and fluvastatin. Then, Fluplatin self-assembles and is further \nencapsulated with poly-(ethylene glycol)-phosphoethanolamine (PEG-PE), we obtain \nFluplatin@PEG-PE nanoparticles (FP NPs). FP NPs can degrade mutant p53 (mutp53) \nand efficiently trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). In this study, we \nshow that FP NPs relieve the inhibition of cisplatin chemotherapy caused by \nmutp53, exhibiting highly effective tumor suppression and improving the poor \nNSCLC prognosis.\n\n\u00a9 2024.

Among all lung \nadenocarcinomas, the most prevalent subset develops via tumorigenesis and \nprogression from atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) to adenocarcinoma in \nsitu (AIS), to minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), to overt invasive \nadenocarcinoma with a lepidic pattern. This stepwise development is supported by \nthe clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of these tumors. In the \n2015 World Health Organization classification, AAH and AIS are both defined as \npreinvasive lesions, whereas MIA is identified as an early invasive \nadenocarcinoma that is not expected to recur if removed completely. Recent \nstudies have examined the molecular features of lung adenocarcinoma \ntumorigenesis and progression. EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma frequently develops \nvia the multistep progression. Oncogene-induced senescence appears to decrease \nthe frequency of the multistep progression in KRAS- or BRAF-mutated \nadenocarcinoma, whose tumor evolution may be associated with epigenetic \nalterations and kinase-inactive mutations. This review summarizes the current \nknowledge of tumorigenesis and tumor progression in early lung adenocarcinoma, \nwith special focus on its clinicopathological characteristics and their \nassociations with driver mutations (EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF) as well as on its \nmolecular pathogenesis and progression.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms19041259\nPMCID: PMC5979290\nPMID: 29690599 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The author declares no conflict of interest.\n\n\n9.

The effect of concurrent genomic \nalterations on outcome has been incompletely described.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective study, targeted next-generation sequencing data \nwere collected from patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer treated at the \nDana-Farber Cancer Institute. Clinical data were collected and correlated with \nsomatic mutation data. Associations between TP53 mutation status, genomic \nfeatures, and mutational processes were analyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 269 patients were identified for inclusion in the cohort. \nAmong 185 response-assessable patients with pretreatment specimens, TP53 \nalterations were the most common event associated with decreased first-line \nprogression-free survival and decreased overall survival, along with DNMT3A, \nKEAP1, and ASXL1 alterations. Reduced progression-free survival on later-line \nosimertinib in 33 patients was associated with MET, APC, and ERBB4 alterations. \nFurther investigation of the effect of TP53 alterations revealed an association \nwith worse outcomes even in patients with good initial radiographic response, \nand faster acquisition of T790M and other resistance mechanisms. TP53-mutated \ntumors had higher mutational burdens and increased mutagenesis with exposure to \ntherapy and tobacco. Cell cycle alterations were not independently predictive, \nbut portended worse OS in conjunction with TP53 alterations.\nCONCLUSIONS: TP53 alterations associate with faster resistance evolution \nindependent of mechanism in EGFR-mutant NSCLC and may cooperate with other \ngenomic events to mediate acquisition of resistance mutations to EGFR tyrosine \nkinase inhibitors.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022.

Methods A systematic search was \ncarried out in Pubmed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Medline and Embase \nup to 19 April 2018. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) and \nprogression-free survival (PFS), the relative risk (RR) of objective response \nrate (ORR) were calculated. Results Overall, a total of eight studies comprising \n2979 patients were included. When generally comparing TP53 mutation group with \nTP53 wild-type group, we confirmed the prognostic value of poor OS of TP53 in \nEGFR mutant lung cancers (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.22-2.44, P = 0.002). In subgroup \nanalysis of OS, the prognostic value was maintained in patients treated with \nEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but not in those treated with \nnon-targeted therapy (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.39-3.76, P = 0.001), and was also \nmaintained in patients with advanced-stage lung cancers rather than those of all \nstages (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.61, P = 0.021). For patients treated with EGFR \nTKIs, TP53 commutation was predictive of a poor PFS (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.42-3.36, \nP < 0.001) but the prognostic value on ORR was not observed (RR 1.15, 95% CI \n0.92-1.44, P = 0.212). Additional subgroup analysis based on TP53 mutation \nsubtypes was not pooled due to limited data. Conclusion Generally we confirmed \nthe prognostic value of poor OS and PFS of TP53 commutation in EGFR mutant lung \ncancers, and it should be further investigated and validated regarding the \nprognostic role of TP53 mutation subtypes.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/00325481.2019.1585690\nPMID: 30798634 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Gaucher's disease patients' cells were \nfound to be deficient in the pH 4.0 acid beta-glucosidase, variable in the pH \n5.0 beta-glucosidase, and normal in all other acid hydrolases tested, including \nacid phosphatase, the activity of which is known to be elevated in plasma. Blood \ncells of a patient with Fabry's disease were deficient in alpha-galactosidase \nand normal in all other acid hydrolases tested.\n\nDOI: 10.1084/jem.143.4.975\nPMCID: PMC2190173\nPMID: 3620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
